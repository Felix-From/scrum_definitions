## Definition of Scrum Team

A **Scrum Team** (commonly called the "Team") is a small, co-located, self-organized, self-contained, value-driven group of full-time Team Members who are organized around a specific **Mission**. Their job is to produce **High-Quality Results** at a **Sustainable Pace**. The Scrum Team collaborates closely to ensure that they deliver value incrementally while continuously improving their processes and work.

### Examples

- A Scrum Team’s work is managed with a **Product Backlog** (Backlog), which is a collection of **Product Backlog Items** (Items) that represent the work that needs to be done. The Scrum Team works together to prioritize, refine, and complete these items in a series of sprints.

- To be successful, the **Product Owner** must be accountable for the Scrum Team’s product. The Product Owner should be an active member of the Scrum Team, ensuring the right priorities are set for the work and providing the necessary guidance.

- **Eliminate future planned-out work** that can cause problems for Scrum Teams by adopting a "just-in-time" approach. This means only agreeing to take on new **Stories** when the Team becomes available to work on them after completing the existing work, ensuring that they stay focused and avoid overcommitting.
