## The Sprint Goal Commitment

In the **Scrum Guide**, each Scrum artifact (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment) has an associated commitment which provides transparency and focus, against which progress can be measured. These commitments solidify the accountabilities of the **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master**, and **Developers**. The commitment of the [**Sprint Backlog**](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-backlog) is the **Sprint Goal**.

The **Sprint Goal** is the **single objective** for the [**Sprint**](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-in-scrum). Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates **cohesiveness and focus**, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

The Sprint Goal is created during [**Sprint Planning**](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-sprint-planning) by the **Scrum Team** and then added to the Sprint Backlog. As the Developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind. If the work evolves and is not what they expected (e.g., more or less complex), they collaborate with the [Product Owner](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-owner) to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog without affecting the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal does not change during a Sprint. However, there are cases where the Scrum Team discovers something that invalidates the Sprint Goal. In such cases, the situation or environment will influence the next steps, which may include possibly canceling the Sprint.

### Sprint Goal Characteristics

When creating a **Sprint Goal**, it is crucial to ensure that it is clear what the Scrum Team is aiming to achieve during the Sprint. The goal should be attainable. Since the Sprint Goal is meant to create focus, it should not be too large, as this could have the opposite effect.

Scrum focuses on delivering value incrementally, so your Sprint Goal should align with that principle to maintain the team's focus. It is also essential that the Sprint Goal remains **visible** throughout the Sprint so that the Scrum Team does not lose sight of it. The purpose of the [Daily Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-daily-scrum) is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal, so it is important for Scrum Teams to continue practicing this.
