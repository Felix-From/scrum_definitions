## Definition of Kanban

**Kanban** is an Agile framework that emphasizes a continuous workflow with a highly visual process, differing from frameworks like Scrum that use fixed iterations. Kanban focuses on delivering shippable products through ongoing improvements and is adaptable, as it doesn’t require a specific setup or procedure. This framework encourages small, incremental changes to optimize the process, and it prioritizes completing projects as a whole rather than breaking them into sprints.

### Use of Kanban

In Kanban, teams manage their work using a **Kanban board**—a visual tool that organizes tasks for the final product. A typical Kanban board has three primary columns:
- **To Do**
- **Doing**
- **Done**

However, teams can add customized columns based on their product or process needs, such as “Testing” or “Deploy.” Rather than being assigned tasks, team members pull work items from the **Product Backlog** (To Do column). The primary constraint in Kanban is the **Work in Progress (WIP) limit**, which caps the amount of active work in the pipeline to prevent overload and ensure smooth progress.

Although Kanban is widely used in software development, it’s also effective in various project types across multiple industries.

### Benefits of Kanban

Kanban provides numerous advantages, including:
- Increased team efficiency
- Higher productivity
- Flexibility and adaptability to changes
- Reduced cycle time
- Optimized workflow
- Support for continuous improvement
- Improved ability to forecast future work

Kanban’s visual and iterative nature makes it a powerful tool for enhancing workflow and boosting team performance.
