## Definition of StoryPoint

A **Story Point** is a relative measure of the size or complexity of a **Story**. It is often used to estimate the effort or time required to complete a task, but it is different from an **Effort Point**. Story Points are typically assigned based on the team's collective experience and historical performance, and they help to provide a way to measure and compare the relative size of tasks.

### Examples

- Some teams use **Story Points** to represent a relative measure of **Ideal Effort**, which is the effort a Story should take if everything goes according to plan. In this scenario, Story Points represent the expected complexity of the product itself, not the difficulty of development or external factors like impediments.
  
- Due to impediments or unexpected issues, some **Story Points** can feel heavier than others. For instance, some **two-point Stories** may end up requiring more effort than others that are rated as **eight-point Stories**. These differences arise because external factors, such as impediments, can sometimes make the work harder than originally anticipated.
