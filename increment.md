### Learn About the Scrum Artifact: Increment

In Scrum, an **Increment** is a critical artifact that represents a concrete step toward achieving the Product Goal. According to the Scrum Guide:

- Each Increment builds upon all previous Increments, creating an integrated and cohesive product.
- Every Increment is thoroughly verified to ensure compatibility with prior Increments, meaning they all work seamlessly together.
- To deliver value, an Increment must be usable, representing a functional piece of the product.

### Key Points About Increments:
- **Multiple Increments per Sprint**: More than one Increment can be developed within a single Sprint. All Increments created during the Sprint are presented together at the Sprint Review, aligning with the principles of empiricism.
- **Early Delivery Option**: Although all Increments are showcased at the Sprint Review, they can also be delivered to stakeholders before the Sprint ends. The Sprint Review is not a gate for releasing value.
- **Definition of Done Compliance**: Only work that meets the **Definition of Done** can be considered part of an Increment. This ensures that each Increment meets quality and completion standards necessary to be truly usable.

Each Increment, as an artifact, is essential for demonstrating progress, supporting continuous delivery, and aligning with Scrumâ€™s iterative development approach.
