# Definition of Done (DoD) Commitment

The **Definition of Done** (DoD) is a critical commitment in Scrum that ensures each **Increment** of a product is complete and meets the necessary quality standards before release. For new Scrum practitioners, it’s helpful to think of Done as a clear list of ingredients required for an Increment to be complete.

## Purpose of the Definition of Done

The **Scrum Guide** defines the DoD as a **formal description** of an Increment’s state when it satisfies the quality criteria for the product. When an Increment meets the DoD:
- It is **considered Done** and ready for delivery.
- It ensures **transparency** by providing a shared understanding of the work completed and the quality standards met.

In essence, the DoD acts as the commitment from the Developers that all required standards for an Increment are fulfilled, just as the **Sprint Goal** is the commitment for the Sprint Backlog and the **Product Goal** is the commitment for the Product Backlog.

## Benefits of the Definition of Done

- **Clarity and Transparency**: It establishes a clear standard for what “done” means, ensuring everyone understands the quality criteria for completed work.
- **Preventing Release of Incomplete Work**: If a Product Backlog Item (PBI) does not meet the DoD, it cannot be released.
- **Consistency in Quality**: It sets a baseline for quality that must be met for all Increments, helping the team maintain high standards.

## DoD and Organizational Standards

The DoD may incorporate **organizational standards** when they exist:
- If organization-wide standards apply, all Scrum Teams must adhere to these as a **minimum** requirement.
- Teams can expand on the DoD with additional criteria specific to the product if needed.
- In the absence of set standards, the **Scrum Team** collaborates to create a DoD suitable for the product’s needs.

## How to Create a Definition of Done

Creating a DoD involves the Scrum Team working together to establish a list of quality criteria an Increment must meet. This process might include:
- **Collaborative Brainstorming**: Teams can brainstorm using resources like **Liberating Structures** to ensure diverse input.
- **Documentation**: The team should document these standards so everyone has a clear understanding of the DoD.

### Examples of Definition of Done Criteria

#### For a Written Marketing Case Study
1. Adheres to featured client branding guidelines.
2. Written in **AP style**.
3. **Reviewed by the client** and feedback received.
4. **Feedback implemented** in the final draft.
5. **Client-approved final draft**.

#### For a Health-Focused Software Application
1. **All testing completed**.
2. **No known defects** remain.
3. **Code review completed** and passed.
4. **Meets HIPAA Compliance** standards.
5. **Satisfies general security requirements**.

Once all items in the DoD are checked off, the Increment is considered Done and ready for release.

## Summary

The **Definition of Done** is essential for maintaining quality and consistency in Scrum. By setting clear standards, the DoD ensures:
- **Shared understanding** of what constitutes completion.
- **High-quality Increments** are consistently delivered.
- Teams follow an **agreed-upon standard** to avoid releasing incomplete or substandard work.

This commitment is vital in Scrum, as missing or disregarding the DoD leads to lower transparency, unpredictability, and a decline in quality.
