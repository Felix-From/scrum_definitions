# Ideal Days

In *Essential Scrum*, Kenneth Rubin defines **ideal days** as:

> "A unit for estimating the size of product backlog items based on how long an item would take to complete if it were the only work being performed, there were no interruptions, and all resources necessary to complete the work were immediately available."

### Ideal Day

An **ideal day** is:
- A unit used for estimating the size of product backlog items.
- It assumes the item would take a certain amount of time if:
  - It were the only work being performed.
  - There were no interruptions.
  - All resources needed to complete the work were immediately available.

This estimation approach helps teams evaluate work based on a standardized concept of time, unimpacted by external factors.
