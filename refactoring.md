## Definition of Refactoring

**Refactoring** is the process of rewriting existing source code to improve its **readability**, **reusability**, or **structure** without changing its **meaning** or **behavior**.

### Examples
- Once you have the tools necessary for **unit testing** with **continuous integration**, becoming proficient at **refactoring** is mainly about **training**, **practice**, and **experience**.

- If one of the **Team's Stakeholders** requests refactoring as a specific task, it would be considered a **Capability**. However, if the **Team** needs to refactor the code in order to work with **Clean Code**, it is considered a **Chore**.
