## Overview

**Osmotic communication** refers to the natural flow of information into the background awareness of team members, allowing them to pick up relevant information as though by osmosis, without actively seeking it out.

## Importance

Osmotic communication makes communication within teams highly efficient. By creating an environment where information is constantly flowing and easily accessible, the cost of communication is kept low and the feedback rate is high. This ensures that errors are quickly identified and corrected, and knowledge is rapidly disseminated throughout the team.

## Body

Osmotic communication typically occurs when team members are seated in close proximity to each other, often in the same room. When one person asks a question, others in the room can either engage in the discussion or continue with their tasks. This approach allows information to be exchanged with minimal disruption.

For example, in a team engaging in **pair programming**, one developer might ask a question, and another team member might overhear it and contribute, often without the initial asker even realizing it. Here's an example of how osmotic communication might work:

> *"We had four people doing pair programming. The boss walked in and asked my partner a question. I started answering it, but gave the wrong name of a module. Nancy, programming with Neil, corrected me, without Neil ever noticing that she had spoken or that a question had been asked."*

When osmotic communication is in place, questions and answers flow naturally and effortlessly among team members, fostering a collaborative and dynamic environment.

## History

The term **osmotic communication** was coined by **Alistair Cockburn**. It was first introduced in his 2004 book *Crystal Clear: A Human-Powered Methodology for Small Teams* and further elaborated in his 2006 book *Agile Software Development: The Cooperative Game*.
