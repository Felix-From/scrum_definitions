## What is Planning Poker?

**Planning Poker** (also known as **Scrum Poker**) is a collaborative technique used by agile teams to estimate the effort or time needed to complete each item on their product backlog. This gamified method involves participants using physical cards to estimate the number of **story points** for each task or user story under consideration.

### Purpose
Planning Poker was designed to help software organizations:
- **Accurately estimate development timelines**
- **Build consensus** among cross-functional team members
- **Strategically plan** and prioritize the teamâ€™s work.

## How Does Planning Poker Work?

Planning poker involves bringing together stakeholders from various departments (e.g., product owner, developers, UX designers, QA testers, product managers) to collaboratively estimate the effort for each backlog item.

### Steps of Planning Poker

1. **Hand Out the Cards**  
   Each participant is given a deck of cards, typically with numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or Mike Cohn's recommended sequence (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100). The cards represent different estimates for the task's complexity, and the limited range helps prevent inefficiencies.

2. **Read the Story**  
   The product owner or product manager reads each user story aloud to the team to ensure everyone understands the task.

3. **Discuss**  
   The group discusses the task, including considerations such as required skill sets, potential obstacles, and team involvement. This step allows team members to ask questions and clarify their understanding of the story.

4. **Estimate and Share**  
   After the discussion, each participant secretly selects a card representing their estimate of the effort needed. Once everyone is ready, all cards are revealed simultaneously. The number on the card chosen represents the estimated complexity of the task.

5. **Work Toward Consensus**  
   If everyone selects the same card, that number becomes the consensus estimate. The group can then move on to the next story. If the estimates differ, the group discusses the reasons behind their choices. Participants with higher or lower estimates explain their reasoning, and the group tries to reach a consensus. After further discussion, participants will reselect their cards and reveal them again.

## History of Planning Poker

Planning Poker traces its origins to a technique called **Wideband Delphi**, developed by the RAND Corporation in the mid-20th century. James Grenning refined this method in 2002, naming it Planning Poker and adapting it for agile teams. Mike Cohn, from Mountain Goat Software, popularized Planning Poker further with his 2005 book *Agile Estimating and Planning*.

## Which Organizations Should Use Planning Poker?

Planning poker can be beneficial for any team in any organization, but it works particularly well for smaller businesses and teams. In larger organizations, with many people involved, the process might take longer and be less efficient.

## Benefits and Drawbacks of Planning Poker

### Benefits:
1. **Encourages collaboration** and team building through a gamified framework.
2. **Increases morale** by giving all team members a voice in the estimation process, rather than relying on a single decision-maker.
3. **Uncovers valuable insights** during the discussion phase, especially from quieter team members who might not normally voice their opinions.

### Drawbacks:
1. **False sense of consensus**: The team may feel overconfident about their estimates, even if important information is missing.
2. **Dominating participants**: A dominant voice in the group could sway others, leading to inaccurate estimates based on force of will rather than consensus.
3. **Optimistic estimates**: Group discussions may cause the team to become overly optimistic, leading to estimates that are more ambitious than what could realistically be accomplished.
