### **Definition of Work in Progress**

The **Stories** that the Team is currently working on.

### **Examples**

- This leads to the notion of **Work in Progress (WIP)**, which is a collection of Stories that are actually being worked on all at the same time.

- Managing the **Work in Progress** replaces the re-planning with constant planning and avoids unnecessary planning that later turns out to be wrong.
