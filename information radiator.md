### What is an Information Radiator?

An **Information Radiator** is a visible display, often handwritten, printed, or electronic, that a team places in a prominent location. This display provides at-a-glance updates on key metrics like automated test counts, velocity, incident reports, or continuous integration status. The goal is to keep the team and passers-by informed on the latest project details.

#### Alternative Names
- **Big Visible Chart**: A nearly synonymous term.
- **Informative Workspaces**: A broader term covering any workspace setup designed to display relevant project information.

#### Expected Benefits
Information radiators offer more than just data; they promote transparency and accountability. The benefits include:

1. **Transparency for Visitors**: The team visibly shares its progress and challenges with customers and stakeholders.
2. **Accountability for the Team**: The team openly acknowledges issues and progress, reinforcing shared responsibility.
3. **Increased Communication**: Information radiators encourage conversations with outsiders, which can lead to fresh ideas and insights.

#### Origins
- **1980s**: Inspired by the Toyota Production System’s “visual control,” a precursor to information radiators.
- **1999**: Kent Beck introduces the term “Big Visible Chart” in *Extreme Programming Explained*, later crediting Martin Fowler.
- **2001**: Alistair Cockburn coins the term **“Information Radiator,”** comparing the spread of information to heat or gas dispersion, emphasizing the need for easily accessible information.

Information radiators have since become a core practice in agile frameworks, helping teams and stakeholders stay aligned on project goals and progress.
