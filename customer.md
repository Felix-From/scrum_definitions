# Customers

## Definition of Customers
**Customers** are the individuals or entities who will be paying for the product or outcomes delivered by the project.

## Key Interests of Customers
Customers typically focus on essential project aspects such as:
- **Schedules**: Expected timelines for project milestones and final delivery
- **Budgets and Costs**: Overall project costs and budget adherence
- **Delivery Dates**: When the product or service will be available

## Customer Expectations
A successful project requires a deep understanding of the customer's unique needs rather than a "one-size-fits-all" approach. Customers expect teams to:
- Take time to understand the **specific requirements** of each division or department involved
- Avoid dictating standardized solutions that may not align with the diverse needs of different stakeholders

By addressing these individual needs, teams can build a more valuable and tailored product that meets each customer's expectations.
