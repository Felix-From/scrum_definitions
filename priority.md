## Definition of Priority

In the context of Scrum, the **priority** of an item is determined by its **placement in the backlog**, not necessarily by its business value. While business value often plays a role in determining the overall importance of an item, in Scrum, priority refers to **when** an item will be undertaken.

### Examples
- The **higher the priority** of an item, the more detailed and ready it must be for planning and execution. These are often referred to as **'Ready' Items**.
- **Prioritization** in Scrum dictates the order in which the team addresses items on the backlog. The **next item to be worked on** is always the **highest priority item**.
