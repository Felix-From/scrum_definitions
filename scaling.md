## Definition of Scaling

**Scaling** refers to the changes in structure and governance that enable the successful growth (or reduction) of production. It is the process of increasing or decreasing one or more dimensions of an organization to improve its success. Essentially, scaling is about adjusting the capacity, resources, and processes of an organization to meet growing demands or to adapt to a reduction in resources.

### Examples
- "It's much safer to scale the company in relation to the leads you can generate than it is to hire new people to generate leads," says Balloon Works's Sidney Conn. "When we scale up, it's in manufacturing. Our sales staff can take on new orders without many new people."
- "We lost a lot of our customers in the recession, and had to scale back our development staff."

### Discussion
The purpose of an organization is to produce results that provide value for its stakeholders and to do so in an effective and efficient manner. This is accomplished even when stakeholders change their minds or disagree with each other about what they want. Most organizations naturally desire growth in order to provide more value to more stakeholders. The challenge lies in managing this growth effectively â€” this is the essence of the **scaling challenge**.

Scaling involves adjusting to growth while maintaining or improving efficiency, ensuring that the organization continues to meet the needs of its stakeholders without compromising its effectiveness.
