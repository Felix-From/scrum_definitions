## What is the Niko-niko Calendar?

The **Niko-niko Calendar** is a simple visual tool used by Agile teams to track team members' daily moods over time. A calendar is installed on a visible wall in the team’s workspace, where each member records their mood at the end of each workday. Team members mark their daily mood using either hand-drawn emoticons or colored stickers, with a color code often representing:
- **Blue** for a bad day
- **Red** for a neutral day
- **Yellow** for a good day

Over time, the Niko-niko calendar shows mood patterns, helping teams and managers observe trends in team morale or the well-being of individual members.

### Also Known As

The term **Niko-niko** comes from the Japanese word “niko,” which means “smile.” In Japanese, repeating the word (as “niko-niko”) makes it mean something closer to “smiley.” This calendar is sometimes also called a **mood board** and is classified as an **information radiator** in Agile.

### Expected Benefits

The Niko-niko Calendar helps make the subjective aspect of team well-being more **visible and measurable**. It provides an objective view of team morale over time, revealing mood trends that may affect team performance. This practice aligns with the **Gilb Measurability Principle**: "anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to not measuring it at all." Essentially, even if the measure is not exact, it allows teams to gain insights into emotional factors that were previously difficult to track.

### Common Pitfalls

Self-censorship can be a drawback when using Niko-niko Calendars. Team members may avoid recording negative moods if they fear it could be seen as “whining” or fear criticism from management or peers. To ensure honest and accurate mood tracking, a non-judgmental team culture is essential.

### Origins

- **2001**: The concept of tracking team mood was seen in Norm Kerth’s *"Project Retrospectives,"* which included an **Energy Seismograph** tool, considered a precursor to the Niko-niko Calendar.
- **2006**: The Niko-niko Calendar was first formally described by **Akinori Sakata** in [this web article](https://sites.google.com/view/niko-niko-calendar/home/en).
