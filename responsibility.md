## Definition of Responsible

**Responsible** people are the individual(s) who actually perform the work or task. Responsibility can be shared among multiple people, and the degree of responsibility is typically determined by the person with the **Accountability**. It is important to note that **Responsibility** is often confused with **Accountability**, but they are distinct concepts.

### Examples
- In practice, it is almost impossible to know when the **Last Responsible Moment** is, and people often wind up delaying decisions for way too long.

### Difference Between Responsibility and Accountability

**Responsibility** refers to the actual execution or completion of tasks, often by multiple individuals, and it can be distributed among team members. It is the "doing" part of the work.

**Accountability**, on the other hand, refers to being answerable for the outcomes of the tasks and ensuring that the work is completed successfully. The accountable person is the one who ultimately owns the result, even if they delegate the work to others. While responsibility can be shared, **accountability is singular** â€” only one person or role can be accountable for a particular outcome. 

To clarify further:
- **Responsible** people are those who carry out the tasks, and they might share this role with others.
- **Accountable** people are the ones who are held to account for ensuring that the task gets done, often with the final responsibility for the outcome resting on their shoulders.
