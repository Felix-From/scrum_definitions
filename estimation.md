# Understanding Estimates in Scrum

An **estimate** is our best guess for what can be achieved and by when. There are some situations when estimates are very important:

## **When Estimates Are Important**

1. **Coordinate Dependencies**  
   It can be very useful to know when the team can proceed working on a new design if the key expert is temporarily out of office.

2. **Align Priorities**  
   During the day, we have a list of things to do. Often, we estimate the efforts to sort out our priorities.

3. **Choose the "Best Value" Option**  
   Estimates help us to make decisions when we choose between different options, for instance, when I choose the best car for a budget.

4. **Forecast the Weather**  
   A forecast is a great way to be better prepared for the future. Forecasts are often based on empirical evidence.

5. **Shared Understanding**  
   When a married couple disagrees on the benefits of moving into a new house, it is probably better to sit down and validate some of the assumptions behind the disagreement.

## **When Not to Estimate**

The biggest problem with an estimate is that there's always someone who will rely on it. I have to inform the other person all the time if I see that my estimate is no longer accurate. An estimate is often perceived as a commitment. What if I have estimated a dozen different things for different people at the same time? This means I have to create an ideal plan to meet those estimates. Any changes to my estimates are not appreciated because they impact all other plans. At the end of the day, I feel overwhelmed with a time-management mess. I spend more time updating plans than actually doing the work. There are situations when estimates don't help:

1. **Predicting Results of Complex Work**  
   Estimating complex work leads to time-management mess.

2. **Focusing Someone to Work Better**  
   Humans struggle to demonstrate the best results under time pressure. This is why professionals strive to increase estimates â€“ to make life easier.

3. **Increase Effectiveness of Time Management**  
   Estimates actually decrease effectiveness due to **Parkinson's Law** ([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)).

## **What Does Scrum Say About Estimates?**

The **Scrum Guide** mentions "estimate" at least nine times, which means that estimates are still an important aspect of the framework. But interestingly:

> _Scrum doesn't impose any specific estimation technique._  
**Poker planning, story points, focus factor, dirty hours, and mandays** are not part of the Scrum Framework. Scrum only establishes some rules around estimates and gives teams the freedom to choose their estimation technique.

### **Product Backlog Items Should be Estimated**

Without estimates, the Product Backlog is not transparent. The Product Owner still needs to:

- **Align priorities**
- Help the development team to find the "best value" option
- **Forecast the weather** for customers or stakeholders

However, when we estimate PBIs (Product Backlog Items), we don't try to predict the exact time to complete them. Therefore, the team can choose an estimation technique that fits their needs. Many Scrum teams use **t-shirt sizes** or **relative story points**, but Scrum doesn't prescribe these techniques.

Estimation of new PBIs can be a part of regular product backlog refinement activities. It can help the development team to come to a shared understanding of the requirements. **Planning poker** is another great technique to validate that everyone in the team is on the same page.

### **The People Who Will Perform the Work Make the Final Estimate**

In Scrum, the **Product Owner** cannot commit to delivering a feature on a certain date before the development team has estimated it first. However, the Product Owner can **forecast** the date if they understand the size of the feature and place it in the Product Backlog in a certain order. Measurable estimates make the progress visible to stakeholders.

### **Estimate How Much Work Can Be Done in the Sprint**

You might be surprised, but Scrum doesn't require you to estimate the units of work in the Sprint Backlog. Many Scrum teams still use estimates to figure out how much work they can fit in, while others use their best guess based on empirical evidence from previous Sprints. Some Scrum teams are even able to prepare the Sprint Backlog without estimates at all, such as those using the **#NoEstimate** approach.

### **Update Estimate During the Sprint**

For the Development Team to be transparent with each other, it's critical to have **Daily Scrum** meetings and update the progress. Any form of progress (numbers, status on the board, checklist, burn-down chart) can help coordinate work and dependencies inside the Development Team. Burn-down charts are complementary in Scrum, but many Scrum Masters worry too much about their burn-downs and how to become more predictable. Relax, you won't always be predictable, and using the burn-down chart as an indicator of team improvement in terms of planning is counterproductive.

## **Estimate or Not to Estimate**

This is the question. As mentioned, there are five reasons why estimates still matter:

1. **Coordinate dependencies**
2. **Align priorities**
3. **Choose the best value option**
4. **Forecast the weather**
5. **Shared understanding**

Often, the simplest possible estimation technique for these five areas is enough to maintain transparency. Scrum doesn't mandate the use of well-known agile or traditional estimation approaches. The Scrum framework is just a set of rules that reminds us that **inspection, adaptation, and transparency** are critical for an empirical process.

## **Timebox and Priorities Instead of Estimates**

When working on complex products, what can we do to increase the probability of completing the work? How can we focus the team and improve time-management? As discussed earlier, prediction with estimates doesn't help, but Scrum suggests using **timeboxing** instead:

1. **Sprint as a Timebox**  
   The Sprint is a time-boxed iteration. At the beginning of the Sprint, the team sets the Sprint Goal and delivers their best results to achieve it within the timebox. This helps the team increase the probability of achieving product goals at least every month.

2. **Size of the Sprint Backlog Work Item is One Day or Less**  
   It's recommended to use this Scrum Guide suggestion as a **timebox** rather than an estimate. It helps the team stay focused during the day and achieve validated accomplishments at the end. This practice helps the team track progress and find better ways to accomplish complex tasks.

3. **Timebox Scrum Events**  
   Scrum events are also timeboxed to help the team use their time more effectively in meetings.

## **Conclusion**

Scrum helps to build the appropriate culture for product development, establishing rules or recommendations for estimates where they are needed, and recommending timeboxing as a replacement for traditional predictive planning.
