## Definition of Sprint Planning

**Sprint Planning** is a Team session at the beginning of a Sprint in which the Team Members (including the Team Captain) discuss and negotiate amongst themselves to:

1. **Establish Sprint End**: Define the duration and completion date of the Sprint.
2. **Select a Kaizen to accomplish**: Choose a process improvement goal or initiative for the Sprint.
3. **Make sure there are enough Stories Ready or ‘in progress’**: Ensure that there is a sufficient number of ready Stories so that the Team can immediately begin work.
4. **Commit to a Sprint Goal**: Agree on a clear, focused Sprint Goal to aim for during the Sprint.

### Examples

- While these two new Stories are in the **Back Burner**, they may be further refined to ensure they will be ready for **Sprint Planning**.
  
- The Story’s **Agreement** is officially agreed to during Sprint Planning, although it is typically discussed and refined during the **Refinement** process beforehand.
