### **Definition of Waterfall**

In **software**: Progress flows in largely one direction (“downwards” like a waterfall) through the phases of **conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment**, and **maintenance**.

In **general**: A **Waterfall** process is any process with well-defined, sequential steps, with no going back to ‘correct’ a previous step.

Any amount of going back to ‘correct’ previous work is introducing agility into the process, so few actual processes are strictly Waterfall.
