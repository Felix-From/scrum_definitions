## Burn-Down Chart Definition

A Burn-Down Chart is a graphical representation of remaining effort relative to the remaining time within a defined time interval. Simply put, it shows the remaining effort needed for tasks over time. The Burn-Down Chart is a line chart used to predict whether the planned work will be completed by the planned deadline.

Burn-Down Charts are commonly used in agile development projects, especially in Scrum; thus, they are also referred to as Sprint Burn-Down Charts. However, they can be applied in any project—such as for iterations or releases—where progress or completion levels are measurable. The term “burn down” indicates how much work has already been completed; a direct translation into German as “burned work” makes little sense.

## Benefits of Burn-Down Charts

As a tool for project and development control, the Burn-Down Chart offers several advantages:

* With a little practice, it is easy to understand (see examples below).
* It provides a quick overview of the remaining effort in the Sprint, iteration, or project.
* It visualizes the current status of completed versus planned work on a given date—in other words, it shows the state of work as of the current day.

## Prerequisites for Using Burn-Down Charts

For it to deliver these benefits, there are a few prerequisites for using the chart:

* There must be a shared understanding of the chart’s structure. It is relatively common to show remaining effort in hours on the Y-axis of the Burn-Down Chart. However, Story Points or tasks may also be used. On the X-axis, days until the end of the defined time interval are most commonly shown. Theoretically, alternative markers like milestones could also be used.
* It must be continuously maintained to enable relatively valid assumptions. Each team member estimates the remaining effort for their tasks daily, which are then cumulatively displayed on the chart.
* The remaining effort must be estimable for team members; in other words, the tasks must be planned at a reasonable level of granularity. As new insights arise, it may happen that remaining efforts are estimated to be higher than on the previous day.
