### **Triangulation in Scrum**

While **triangulation** is not a widely recognized term in Scrum, it can be applied in various ways to support decision-making and enhance Scrum practices. Essentially, triangulation involves gathering, comparing, and cross-referencing data or feedback from multiple sources to ensure accuracy, balance, and better-informed decisions.

Here are some contexts where **triangulation** might be useful in Scrum:

---

#### 1. **Data Triangulation (Scrum Metrics and Analysis)**
Triangulation in Scrum could refer to using multiple data sources to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a situation. For example, in a **Sprint Retrospective**, the team might combine insights from:

- **Velocity**
- **Burndown charts**
- **Team feedback**

This helps the team understand issues more holistically and improve processes for the next Sprint.

---

#### 2. **Stakeholder Triangulation (Communication)**
Triangulation can refer to balancing the perspectives of different stakeholders. During events like **Sprint Reviews** or **Product Backlog Refinement** sessions, a Scrum Team might triangulate feedback from:

- **Product Owner**
- **Development Team**
- **Stakeholders/Customers**

This ensures that the priorities and requirements are well-aligned across all perspectives.

---

#### 3. **Feedback Triangulation (Decision-Making)**
In Scrum, triangulation could also involve cross-referencing feedback from different team members or from different stages of the process. For instance, the team may gather feedback from:

- **Developers**
- **Scrum Master**
- **Product Owner**

This approach ensures that decisions are informed by a broad set of insights, preventing them from being based on a single perspective.

---

#### 4. **Triangulation of Requirements (User Stories)**
Triangulation can be applied when clarifying requirements for user stories. A team might look at a user story from different angles, such as:

- **Business needs**
- **Technical needs**
- **User needs**

This ensures a shared understanding across the entire Scrum Team about what needs to be done.

---

### **In Summary**
While "triangulation" isn't a core Scrum term, it can be understood as the act of gathering, comparing, and cross-referencing information from multiple sources to gain a more accurate and balanced perspective. This practice ultimately supports more effective decision-making and process improvement within Scrum.
