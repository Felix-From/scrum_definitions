# Commitments: A Little New and a Little Old

In **2020**, the **Scrum Guide** introduced the concept of commitments, with one commitment for each artifact (physical things). These commitments are:

- **The Definition of Done**
- **The Sprint Goal**
- **The Product Goal**

Of these three, **Sprint Goal** and **Definition of Done** have been around for quite some time, but not explicitly referred to as "commitments." The **Product Goal** is the new addition.

## What is a Commitment?

A commitment can be defined as a pledge or promise—similar to an obligation. A commitment can be:

- A binding promise or contract.
- A firm decision to do something.

If a commitment is missed, it means the promise was not fulfilled, leading to a failure of duty. These are strong words with clear direction to meet the commitment.

## What Does the Scrum Guide Say?

According to the Scrum Guide:

> “Each artifact is committed to ensuring it provides information that enhances transparency and focuses progress. These commitments reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.”  
> — [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

### In Summary:
- **The Definition of Done** is what the team commits to producing in an increment.
- **The Sprint Goal** is what the team commits to fulfilling during the sprint.
- **The Product Goal** is what the team commits to fulfilling for the product.

## Commitments: The "WHY" Behind the Artifact

These three commitments are the **why** behind their related artifacts. For a great explanation of the importance of "why," see **Simon Sinek’s "Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action."**

Scrum commitments make it clear to the team members **why** they are working on a particular artifact and how this work contributes to the common goal.

## Example: Sprint Goal

In some interpretations of Scrum, teams have been expected to commit to completing the work selected for the sprint backlog. This often includes **commitment to the actual plan** devised from the tasks within the sprint backlog. However, committing to the **Sprint Goal** is different and more flexible than committing to specific tasks.

- During **sprint planning**, Product Backlog Items (PBIs) are selected for the sprint and added to the sprint backlog. Then a plan is created to complete these items—often in the form of tasks.
- In a **command and control approach**, if the team is struggling to meet the “committed work,” management tends to pressure the team to meet deadlines or stay within scope.

### The Power of Commitments

Shifting the focus from plans to goals leads to more flexibility and shared accountability. If the team cannot complete selected PBIs or follow the original plan, their **commitment is to the Sprint Goal**, not the details.

The team can work with the **Product Owner** to determine a better way to achieve the Sprint Goal. This could involve adjusting the original plan or changing the intent of the work in the Sprint Backlog.

The Scrum Team commits to the **Sprint Goal**, not the selected work. While the sprint backlog should contain a meaningful plan, there should be flexibility and agility in how that plan is executed.

## Summary

- **Commitments** in the **Scrum Guide 2020** separate the **why** from the **how**, leaving the why in the hands of the team during planning, and the how to be determined through the actual creation of the product.
- The **Sprint Goal** provides flexibility in the Sprint, while the **Product Goal** helps the Product Owner manage the product backlog with a long-term vision.
- The **Definition of Done** sets quality constraints for the product and ensures the increment is complete.

Commitments are **not optional**. If you’re not using them, you’re practicing a version of Scrum, not the Scrum defined in the **Scrum Guide**. While it may not be your goal to be "proper" with Scrum, deviating from the Scrum Guide can lead to ineffective agility. Leaving out one or more commitments may revert you to a **predictive, command-and-control** approach to product development.

**Don't do it.**
