## Splitting Your Scrum Development Team

By balancing the variety of skill sets amongst multiple different teams, the company will find itself to be more efficient as each team will be able to approach all aspects of the project, instead of simply specializing in one skill. This allows for better flexibility, collaboration, and a more holistic approach to product development.

### Example

Imagine a software development company working on a complex product. Initially, they have separate teams for front-end development, back-end development, and testing. However, they decide to reorganize into cross-functional Scrum teams where each team is responsible for a specific feature of the product. Each new team consists of a mix of front-end developers, back-end developers, and testers. This structure ensures that the teams can independently handle all aspects of developing and delivering features, from coding to testing and deployment, without needing to rely on specialists from other teams. As a result, the company becomes more efficient, with quicker feedback loops and a more integrated workflow.
