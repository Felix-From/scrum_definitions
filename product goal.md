## Definition of Product Goal

The **Product Goal** is the ‘next’ milestone in the development of the product. It represents the next significant target that the team is working towards. Once the Product Goal is achieved, a new one is established to continue guiding the product's evolution.

### Examples
- The **Product Owner (PO)** owns, and presents, the **Product Goal**, along with a set of (refined) user stories that will help the team make progress toward achieving that goal.
- The PO owns the **Product Goal** and uses it to drive the team towards the final destination, while the **Scrum Master** and the **Team** own the **Sprint Goal**, which determines what they are doing to improve the team's performance. The **Sprint Goal** defines success for the sprint and tactically overrides the Product Goal, but the **Product Goal** remains strategic.

### Discussion
**Does the Product Vision translate directly to the Product Goal? Or is it something higher, like OKRs?**

**Answer**: The **Product Goal** is essentially whatever is necessary for the product at a given time. It is considered a stepping stone to the overall value the product aims to deliver. The **Product Goal** serves as a more immediate, tactical focus that aligns with the team’s current sprint work. While the **Product Vision** provides a broad, long-term direction, the **Product Goal** is a specific, actionable milestone that the team works towards. The team itself does not focus heavily on the Product Goal’s formulation, as this responsibility primarily lies with the **Product Owner**.
