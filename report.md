## Definition of "Report" in Scrum

In Scrum, the term **"Report"** can have different meanings depending on the context. Generally, it refers to the collection and presentation of information related to the **status**, **progress**, or **performance** of the Scrum team. Here are some common meanings of the term "Report" in Scrum:

### 1. **Burndown Chart**
A commonly used report in Scrum is the **Burndown Chart**, which shows the remaining effort over time. This report helps the team and stakeholders visualize the progress during a sprint or a project.

### 2. **Sprint-Review Report**
At the end of each sprint, there is the **Sprint Review**, where the Scrum team presents the progress, completed tasks, and potential adjustments. A **Sprint-Review Report** might include a summary of the work done during the sprint and feedback from stakeholders.

### 3. **Velocity Report**
**Velocity** is a measure of a Scrum team’s work pace, indicating how many **story points** (or a similar unit) the team has completed in a sprint. A **Velocity Report** displays this metric, helping track the team’s capacity over several sprints.

### 4. **Product Backlog Report**
A **Product Backlog Report** might be a current snapshot of the items in the product backlog, showing their status, priority, and the estimates for the tasks.

### 5. **Impediment Report**

### 6. **Team Performance Report**
A **Team Performance Report** provides an overview of the team’s performance, based on various metrics such as the number of completed tasks, adherence to timelines, or the quality of the work delivered.

### 7. **Daily Scrum "Report"**
