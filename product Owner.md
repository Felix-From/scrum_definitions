## Definition of Product Owner

The term **Product Owner** refers to an individual who plays a key role in the development process by representing the stakeholders and guiding the product's development. Depending on the context, **Product Owner** can encompass various roles, such as **Team Captain**, **Product Champion**, or **Business Owner**, all of which emphasize different aspects of product ownership.

### Examples
- When a **Scrum Team** starts a new project, the **Product Owner** should initiate the **Backlog** by collaborating with stakeholders and team members to capture their needs, wants, desires, and requirements as **Backlog Items**.
  
- The **Product Owner** and the **Team** must continuously update the **Backlog** to ensure that there are prioritized items supporting the **Release Goals** and strategy, while also preparing those items for future planning sessions.

- **Scrum** encourages the **Product Owner** to work closely with the **development team** and **stakeholders** to understand and focus on whatâ€™s coming next (the next priorities and goals for the product).
