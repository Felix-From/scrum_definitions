# What Do You Mean by Ideal Hours?

**Ideal hours** is a concept used in time-based estimations, often for developing work items. It represents the time required to complete a project or task under ideal conditions, assuming no interruptions or unexpected issues.

While ideal hours can be useful for planning, the assumptions made are typically optimistic. Therefore, the accuracy of ideal hours often decreases as the estimated duration increases. However, ideal hours provide consistency since time units are universal, allowing project managers to better forecast functionality costs and expected ROI.

## Ideal Hours Estimation Includes:
- **Measuring work capacity:** Estimating the amount of work a single team member can accomplish in one hour.
- **Accounting for testing time:** Estimating time needed for testing and quality assurance.
- **Total estimate calculation:** Combining work and testing hours to create a comprehensive time estimate.

## Example of Ideal Hours:
