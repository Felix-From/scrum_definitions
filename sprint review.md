## Definition of Sprint Review

The **Sprint Review** consists of a **Product Review** and a **Progress Review**, and may include other types of reviews as well. These reviews often require different participants, so the Sprint Review can sometimes be a series of separate meetings. It is an essential part of Scrum for getting feedback on the work completed during the Sprint and ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations.

### Examples

- The purpose of the **Product Review** is to get meaningful feedback from the stakeholders about the Team’s work results (product). This review is often called the **Sprint Review**, and it is the most important meeting in Scrum, as without this feedback, Scrum won’t work. For this reason, it is crucial to have the right stakeholders in the room for the **Product Review**.

### Discussion

When the Sprint is over, there is a **Product Review** (the Sprint Review is typically broken into two parts: the Product Review and the Progress Review in Scrum 3.0). In this meeting, the **Product Owner** and the Team review the results with their stakeholders for several key reasons: 

1. To prove to the stakeholders that the Team is moving in the right direction.
2. To receive feedback from the stakeholders about the work completed.
3. To discuss the next Sprint’s Goal with the stakeholders.

If necessary, updates to the **Release Goals**, **Release Strategy**, and **Backlog** are made based on the feedback from the Review, considering any changes in business priorities. 

In smaller projects or organizations, intuitive reasoning might suffice for determining the next steps, but as the organization grows, more sophisticated techniques, including metrics, may be used to guide future work.

After the **Product Review**, the Team often holds an internal **Retrospective** to analyze its performance and practices.
