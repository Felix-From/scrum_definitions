# Coaching / Coach

**Note:** In this context, an "agilist" refers to a person who practices or advocates for Agile methodologies.

## Coaching in Agile Context

In Agile, the term “coaching” is used in different ways, depending on the role and context.

### 1. **Agile Coach**

Among agilists, the term **“Agile Coach”** commonly refers to a person who helps individuals and teams achieve their objectives or overcome challenges using Agile approaches. The role of an Agile Coach goes beyond just coaching—they also:

- **Advise** teams on best practices.
- **Lead** initiatives and provide direction.
- **Facilitate** team interactions and decision-making.
- **Teach** Agile principles and methodologies.

An Agile Coach plays a key role in helping teams understand and apply Agile methodologies effectively.

### 2. **The Discipline of Coaching**

Outside of the specific role of an Agile Coach, **coaching** refers to the broader discipline of providing guidance to help others reach their professional or personal goals. Coaching can be both informal or formal, and professional organizations exist that offer certified coaching programs.

- These organizations have formal definitions of what coaching entails.
- Coaching can help individuals or teams improve their performance and achieve desired outcomes.

### Coaching as a Professional Scrum Competency

When referring to **coaching** in the context of **Scrum**, we are typically discussing the discipline of coaching, not the specific role of an Agile Coach. In this sense, coaching skills are used to:

- Increase the effectiveness of a **Scrum Team**.
- Improve outcomes for **Scrum Team members**.

The coach’s role in Scrum is to be a **process expert**, enabling the team to achieve their goals by using various skills such as:

- **Developmental conversations**: Helping individuals grow and improve.
- **Active listening**: Understanding and responding to the needs of team members.
- **Thought-provoking questions**: Encouraging reflection and self-discovery.

Coaches in Scrum take a **neutral stance** regarding how the individual or team achieves their goals. They do not provide direct advice or share personal experiences. This differs from **mentorship**, where the mentor **actively shares advice and personal experiences**.
