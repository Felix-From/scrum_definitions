## Learn About the Scrum Artifact: Sprint Backlog

![Sprint Backlog](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/inline-images/2017-03/SprintBacklog_0.png)

As described in the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org), the **Sprint Backlog** is composed of the [Sprint Goal](/node/66948) (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).

The **Sprint Backlog** is a plan by and for the **Developers**. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal. Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that the team can inspect their progress in the **Daily Scrum**.

### Commitment: Sprint Goal

The **Sprint Goal** is the **single objective** for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates **coherence and focus**, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

The Sprint Goal is created during the **Sprint Planning** event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. As the [Developers](/node/8059) work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind. If the work turns out to be different than expected, they collaborate with the **Product Owner** to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.

### Increment

An **Increment** is a concrete stepping stone toward the [Product Goal](/node/66962). Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.

Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the **Sprint Review**, thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.

Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the **Definition of Done**.
