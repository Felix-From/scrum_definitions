In **Pair Programming**, two software developers share a single workstation and collaborate to develop a single feature. This practice is commonly used within **Scrum** teams and promotes collaborative coding.

### Synonyms for Pair Programming:

## Use of Pair Programming

In pair programming, one programmer takes on the role of the **driver**, responsible for writing the code, while the other, the **navigator**, reviews the code as it is written and provides real-time feedback. The roles of driver and navigator alternate periodically during the work session. 

To ensure the effectiveness of this technique, the workstation must be arranged to comfortably accommodate both programmers. The desk should provide enough space for at least two chairs, and the roomâ€™s noise level should be controlled to allow for productive, focused conversation between the pair(s) without unnecessary distractions.

Pair programming is not limited to software development. The technique can be applied across various industries and roles, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Benefits of Pair Programming
- **Higher Quality Code/Products**: By working together, the pair catches errors early, resulting in more robust code.
- **Increased Shared Knowledge/Skill Transfer**: Both developers learn from each other, gaining new insights and skills.
- **Promotes T-shape Team Members**: Developers become more versatile by gaining expertise in other areas, not just their own specialties.
- **Encourages Communication & Teamwork**: It fosters direct communication, strengthens teamwork, and improves problem-solving.
- **Clarifies Problems and Speeds Up Decision-Making**: Collaborative discussions help quickly identify issues and make decisions.
