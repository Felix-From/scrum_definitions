## Definition of Sprint

A **Sprint** is a fixed period of time (less than a month) in which a Scrum Team produces an Increment of the product that is ready for review. The length of the Sprint is typically consistent across all Sprints and is usually defined by the interval between Product Reviews. Once a Sprint has started, its duration cannot be changed.

### Examples

- The most important part of planning is forecasting which of the **Product Backlog Items** (PBIs) the Team will focus on and complete in the next Sprint.

- One of the most common types of **Placeholder Stories** is the **‘Bug to be Named Later’** story. This reserves some **Story Points** for bugs that the Team might need to fix during the Sprint. These bugs may be in other systems or code, but the Team knows they will need to address them within the Sprint.
