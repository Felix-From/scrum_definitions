### **Definition of User Story**

A **User Story** is a work item that delivers value to the **User** of the software. It was popularized by **eXtreme Programming (XP)** and is a key concept in Agile methodologies.

### **Examples**

- A **Story** is an extension of the **User Story**, which is a concept introduced in **eXtreme Programming (XP)** to represent work that provides value to **users**.
  
- Since not all work items the Scrum Team performs provide value directly to the end user, the concept of a **User Story** can be extended to represent work that provides value to any **stakeholder**, not just the user.
