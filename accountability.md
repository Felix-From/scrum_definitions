## Scrum Accountability – Acting Responsibly

The 2020 Scrum Guide uses the term Accountability instead of roles. It defines accountabilities for:

* Scrum Master,
* Product Owner, and
* Developer.

The idea behind the term Accountability is that each person actively involved in a Scrum team takes on responsibility. But for what? For:

* responsibilities,
* completing tasks,
* upholding commitments,
* fostering a collaborative culture, or
* the outcomes!

## What Does Accountability Mean?

The Cambridge Dictionary defines Accountability as follows:

_“the fact of being responsible for what you do and able to give a satisfactory reason for it, or the degree to which this happens”._

In German, it roughly translates to:

”die Tatsache, für das, was man tut, verantwortlich zu sein und eine zufriedenstellende Begründung dafür geben zu können, oder der Grad, in dem dies geschieht”.

Thus, there is an overlap between Accountability and Responsibility.

And what does the Scrum Guide 2020 state?

_“The Scrum Team is **responsible** for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required…._

_The entire Scrum Team is **accountable** for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint.”_

The excellent German translation of the Scrum Guide rephrases these two sentences as:

_“The Scrum Team is **responsible for implementation** (responsible) for all product-related activities: stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required…_

_The entire Scrum Team is **accountable** for creating a valuable, useful increment every Sprint.”_

Thus, the Scrum Team—Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developers—is both responsible for implementation and accountable for the outcome. Accountability, therefore, goes beyond a general, rather unspecific "being responsible" or "carrying responsibility"; it stands for outcome responsibility.

## Prerequisites for Accountability

The 2020 Scrum Guide introduced several new elements, including emphasizing commitments with artifacts and moving from self-organization to self-management. Self-management goes beyond self-organization. For a Scrum team to take responsibility—both for all product-related activities and outcomes—it is essential to be empowered accordingly. Simply put: the team must not only organize its work independently but also decide who within the team will do what, when, and how. Without this empowerment, outcome responsibility is mere organizational theater.

## Outcome Responsibility of the Team and the Individuals

“The entire Scrum team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint.” What does this mean specifically for Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master?

Developers are accountable for:

* creating the Sprint Backlog,
* adhering to the agreed Definition of Done,
* daily adjustments to the plan to achieve the Sprint Goal, and
* holding each other accountable as professionals.

The Product Owner is accountable for:

* maximizing the value of the product being developed and
* effective Product Backlog management, including developing and communicating the Product Goal, creating and communicating backlog items, and setting their order.

Moreover, they must ensure that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible, and items are understandable.

The Scrum Master is accountable for:

* the effectiveness of the Scrum Team.

To achieve this, they address their activities towards Developers and the Product Owner, as well as towards the organization. Specifically:

* they support Developers in self-management, interdisciplinary collaboration, and focus on the increment to be created, potentially helping to remove impediments and ensure productive, positive Scrum events, including adhering to the timebox.
* they support the Product Owner with techniques for defining the Product Goal, backlog management, empirical product planning, and possibly in collaborating with stakeholders.
* they help the organization, e.g., with planning and implementing, training, and coaching Scrum, conveying the mindset and empirical approach of Scrum, promoting a better understanding of Scrum, and facilitating alignment among the participants, including stakeholders.

## Accountability Versus Role in Scrum

Why does the Scrum Guide emphasize Accountability and omit the term role? The idea is that the titles aren’t job descriptions but rather a **minimum set of responsibilities** required to implement Scrum. The familiar roles of Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developers will still exist in practice. However, job descriptions may expand significantly beyond the responsibilities outlined in the Scrum Guide.

By avoiding the term roles, Scrum takes a different approach compared to other frameworks or models. The V-Modell XT, for example, defines different roles for product creation. Employees with specific roles participate in creating products or outcomes through assigned activities or are responsible for creating them. Aside from distinguishing between project and organizational roles, each role has a specific description covering up to five points:

* tasks and authority,
* skill profile,
* role assignment,
* accountability, and
* participation.

Theoretically, it is conceivable that future job descriptions will define specific Scrum roles accordingly. However, since the Scrum Guide explicitly advocates Lean Thinking as the reduction of waste and focus on essentials, it is unlikely that the use of Accountability instead of role will have a major impact in practice.

## A Gentle Critique of Scrum Accountability

Self-management, commitment, outcome responsibility—these concepts are becoming increasingly important in many organizations. And, of course, that’s a good thing. However, there is also criticism of the Accountability emphasized in the Scrum Guide:

* On closer inspection, the “roles” are more about tasks than outcome responsibility. Example: _“Developers are responsible for creating the Sprint Backlog”_.
* It emphasizes obvious points. Example: _“Developers are responsible for adhering to the Definition of Done”_; a) who else would be? and b) the Definition of Done is established by Developers with a purpose that, naturally, should be achieved.
* Statements about the skills required to take on outcome responsibility are lacking, and potential consequences are not mentioned.

Of course, it’s understandable why no consequences are mentioned, as they would be context-specific on the one hand, and Scrum is based on a defined set of values. The team’s commitment to achieving the agreed Sprint Goal, to quality, to learning, and to doing their best together is essential for collaboration and building an agile culture. If skills are lacking, they need to be developed. A consequence, for example, could be for the team to learn to stop placing responsibility on others and start taking responsibility for their actions, tasks, and promises. This is an exciting process in many organizations and a significant reason why Accountability as a term implies much more than merely naming roles.
